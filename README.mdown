# Introduction

<https://sourceforge.net/projects/mtasc/>

## Notes on this fork
This is derived from the bomberstudios fork which adds useful build automation. As bitrot on the compiler source has set in, making it difficult to build on many modern Linux distributions, this fork adds a build pipeline to make this software usable.
